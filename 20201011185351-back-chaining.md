# Back-chaining #

* Try to pronounce the word backward. Add one letter a time until you can say the whole ling.
* It is an old singer trick that can work-tongue related miracles. 
* It teaches your tongue handles single new combination of two familiar sounds. Split long difficult words into small,
  easy, chunks.
* Example, word "vzdrognu:  
  * o ... gnu ... ognu
  * d ... ognu ... rognu 
  * d ... rognu ... drognu 
  * z ... drognu ... zdrognu 
  * v ... zdrgonu ... vzdrognu (vvvvzzzz-drognu)
* Backward method gives you a chance to repeat the end of the word every time you add a letter.
