# Minimal Pair Testing  #

* Words that have a similar phonetic sounds sometimes is difficult to separate which one of them was spoken.
  * For example they differs by only one sound, like "rock" and "lock", "thinking" and "sinking"
* Instead of wasting your time correcting bad pronunciation habits, you'll be able to spend your time consuming language
  at breakneck speed
* "Sounds rules connect spelling to sound and sound to sound. They tell you which sounds can be combined ("sticks is
  okay in English) and which can't ("svickz" is not). Language are full of complex sound rules, and we're very good at
  picking them up if *we can hear them*." (Fluent Forever, W. Gabriel , Page 62)
* Your brain is hardwire to ignore the differences between foreign sounds. To rewire it, listen to minimal pairs in your
  target language -- similar sounds words like *niece* and *knees* -- and test yourself until your brain adapts to hear
  these new sounds.
* By practicing in this way, you'll be better equipped to recognize word when they're spoken, and you'll have an easier
  time memorizing them on your own.
