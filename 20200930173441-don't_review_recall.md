# Don't review. Recall! #

- Use recall and not review
  * For example: Read a list for five minutes and then make a note about what you remember will make your learning
    more effective in long term. 
  * If possible do this in a row 
- "Every time you succeed at recalling, the reward centers in your brain release a chemical reward --dopamine-- into
  your Hippocampus, further encouraging long-term memory storage." Fluent Forever, David, page 32
- You will accomplish this goal by creating flash cards that test your ability to recall a given word, pronunciation, or
  grammatical construction. Coupled with image and personal connections, these cards will form the foundation of a
  powerful memorization system.
