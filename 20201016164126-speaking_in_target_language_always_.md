# Speaking In Target Language Always  #

* If you are trying to learn a new language use it, speak with it whenever possible
* If you don't have a vocabulary to speak something try to use words you know to explain what you want.
* "Fluency is the ability to communicate your thoughts without stopping every time you run into a problem". (Fluent
  Forever, W. Gabriel, Page 158)
* You have gotten better at using the  words you know to express yourself.
* Refuse to speak in a language that is not your target language.
* Get a word frequency list and discuss every word you don't know in order. Try to find out difference between bar and a
  pub
* Ask you tutor to generate examples sentences for new flashcards.
