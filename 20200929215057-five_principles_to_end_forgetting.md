# Five Principles to End Forgetting #

* We want to study as little as possible and practice recall as much as possible.
* We want our original memories to be as deep and multisensory as possible
* We want our recall practice to be challenging but not too hard
* Last, when we practice, we want to nearly forget those original experiences but not forget them completely.
* When we *do* forget, we want immediate feedback to put us back on track

There is a complex balance between the advantages of nearly forgetting and the disadvantages of actually forgetting, and
it breaks our forgetting curve in half. The single practice session has made the different between forgetting nearly
everything and remembering quite a bit.
