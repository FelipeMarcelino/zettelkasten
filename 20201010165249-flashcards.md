# Flashcards #

* Flashcards are fantastic at reminding you about your original experiences
  - So, it is extremely necessary create your own flashcards with your memories
  - Create your own flashcards is a step that improve your memory through searching images or sounds in Google, creating
    your own sentence to remember a specific word or a grammar rule. 
  - "The card construction process if one of the most fun and satisfying ways to learn a language.. Content in the
    knowledge that every will become a permanent memory, you  become the architect of your own mind." (Fluent Forever,
    W. Gabriel, Page 45)
