# Rewrite The Past #

- Every time you successfully recall a memory, you revisit and rewrite earlier experiences, adding bits and pieces of
  your present self to your past memories.
- You will make the best use of your time when practicing recall if your earlier experiences are as memorable as
  possible. You can accomplish this by connecting sounds, images, and personal connections to every word you learn
- When you *do* forget, use immediate feedback to bring back your forgotten memories
