# Pronunciation and Broken Words #

* "In an ideal world, the written language and the spoken language walk together, hand in hand". (Fluent Forever, W.
  Gabriel, Page 54)
  David)
* Broken words: We *think* a word is pronounced one way, but it is *actually* pronounced a different way.
  * It create a barrier to understand and assimilate native speakers
  * Learning a language at breakneck speed is necessary to understand the phonetic sounds first
* When you know how sound rules work in a target language, new words and bits of grammar find their way into your
  conversation. New words will find their way into your writing. And every input improves your understanding and fluency
  in every aspect of your target language.
* Train your Ears, Rewire your Brain
   * We have some difficult to distinguish some phonetics sounds regarding a target language we want learning
   * [Minimal Pair Testing](20201010173941-minimal_pair_testing_.md)
* "An accurate accent is powerful because it is the ultimate gsture of empathy. It connects you to another person's
  culture in a way that words never can, because you have bent your *body* as well as your mind to match that person's
  culture." (Fluent Forever, W. Gabriel, page 64)
* Create a good accent is possible whenever you put effort on it.
  * With every new word you learn, you'll reinforce good pronunciation habits, and those habits will last you a
    lifetime.
  * Learn new words and pronounce it rightly can improve your understand about a language and its patterns.
* It is possible to learn pronunciation using IPA(International Phonetic Alphabet)
  * It is a guide to teach you how to pronounce words.
  * Every IPA letter is set instruction on how to make that sound.
* [Back-chaining](20201011185351-back-chaining.md) to learn a new word pronunciation.
* Your accent makes your first impression in any language.
* Try to find patterns in word
  * We need to *notice* patterns when it passes by.
    * We could listen to recordings of every new word we read
    * But, phonetic alphabet is the best way to learn patterns
    * Phase out phonetic alphabet when you are overconfident about your pronunciation.
* Take a care: Some languages, which English one of them, shows a different degree of correspondence between its
  spelling and pronunciation.
  * However it is possible to predict pronunciation with sound rules.
* Learn as much as you possibly can about target language sounds, mastering it can make your path to fluency easier.
* "Every language contains a pattern of connections between its spelling and its sounds. If you can internalize that
  pattern and make it automatic, you'll save yourself a great deal of work." (Fluent Forever, W. Gabriel, Page 76)
* Create flashcards to memorize every spelling pattern you need
  *[Flashcards](20201010165249-flashcards.md)
* Connect new sounds to other sounds you already know.
  - Every time we can connect two memories, we strengthen both of them - neurons that fire together wire together 
* In the process, approach foreign sounds and complex patterns from as many angles as you can -- from their spelling to
  their sounds, even down to the individual mouth positions used for each sound. You're taking advantage of one of the
  stranger quirks of learning: the more bits and pieces you learn, the less work it takes to learn them
