# Make Memories More Memorable #

- They are four levels of processing our brain uses to memorize a information
  * Structure
  * Sound
  * Concept
  * Personal connection

- They are more strong from top to bottom. Hence, personal connection is the most efficient way to our brain memorize
  and recover information
- "The four levels of processing are more than a biological quirk: they act as a filter, protecting us from
  information overload", (Fluent Forever,W. Gabriel , Page 20)
  * Our brain consistently works at the shallowest level of processing needed to get the job done.
- **Structure**:  Allow you to recognize patterns of letter, for example:
  - *odctor* = *doctor*
  - It involves too little of your brain to contribute much to memory
- **Sound**: Connects structure to your years and your mouth and allows you to speak.
  - Rhyme is a good way to use get through filter sound

- **Concept**:
  - Abstract: If you have a conversation about a specific holiday like Carnival in Brazil, your brain will make
    association with a data between February and March
  - Concrete: If I tell about a festival that will happens inside carnival holiday or maybe about dress up code, you
    will remember people in streets partying. It is more easy to make an association with this kind of concept because
    it uses multisensory experiences
-  **Personal Experience**: Probably the most easily way to remember about the carnival is whenever you remember a
   personal experience on that date.
- Better results using image with word to remember that word.
  - Visual memory is extraordinary
1. Learn the sound system of your language
2. Bind those sound to images
3. Bind those images to your past experiences
